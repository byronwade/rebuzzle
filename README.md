# Rebus Quest

Rebus Quest is an engaging and addictive puzzle game where players solve daily rebus puzzles. The game challenges players to guess the phrase depicted by combining images, symbols, and text within six tries. Each day presents a new puzzle, encouraging players to return and maintain their streaks.

## How to Play

1. **Guess the Phrase in 3 tries.**
   - Each guess must be a valid rebus puzzle phrase.
   - The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the phrase.

### Examples:

- **Yellow Tile**: A part of your guess is in the phrase but in the wrong spot.

## Detailed Gameplay Instructions

   - Players have 6 tries to guess the phrase.

2. **Making a Guess**:
   - Input your guess in the provided text field.
   - Ensure each guess is a valid phrase that could represent the rebus puzzle.

3. **Color Feedback**:
   - **Green Tile**: A part of your guess (symbol, word, or letter) is correct and in the right spot.
   - **Yellow Tile**: A part of your guess is correct but in the wrong spot.
   - **Gray Tile**: A part of your guess is not in the phrase at all.

4. **Using Hints**:
   - Use hint credits to reveal letters or provide clues about the phrase.

5. **Winning the Game**:

### Example Puzzles:

1. **Rebus Puzzle**: An image of an eye + a picture of a phone = "iPhone"
   - **Guess**: "iPhone"
   - **Feedback**: If "iPhone" is correct, tiles would turn green indicating correct placement.

2. **Rebus Puzzle**: An image of a clock + a picture of wings = "Time Flies"
   - **Guess**: "Time Passes"
